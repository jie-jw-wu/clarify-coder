Polycarp turned $n$ years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!\n\nPolycarp celebrated all of his $n$ birthdays: from the $1$-th to the $n$-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?\n\nAccording to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: $1$, $77$, $777$, $44$ and $999999$. The following numbers are not beautiful: $12$, $11110$, $6969$ and $987654321$.\n\nOf course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).\n\nHelp Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive) that are beautiful. However, Polycarp is not sure if he should consider leading zeros as part of the number or not.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.

This time Anton needs to solve the following problem:\n\nThere are two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It turned out that array $a$ contains only elements from the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nAnton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $(i, j)$ such that $1 \\le i < j \\le n$. It is possible to choose the same pair $(i, j)$ more than once.   Add $a_i$ to $a_j$. In other words, $j$-th element of the array becomes equal to $a_i + a_j$. \n\nFor example, if you are given array $[1, -1, 0]$, you can transform it only to $[1, -1, -1]$, $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$ by one operation.\n\nAnton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $a$ so that it becomes equal to array $b$. Can you help him?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. \n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10000$).

There can be duplicates among elements.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ ($-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$) \u00a0\u2014 elements of array $b$. There can be duplicates among elements.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output one line containing \"YES\" if it's possible to make arrays $a$ and $b$ equal by performing the described operations, or \"NO\" if it's impossible.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3\n1 -1 0\n1 1 -2\n3\n0 1 1\n0 2 2\n2\n1 0\n1 41\n2\n-1 0\n-1 -41\n5\n0 1 -1 1 -1\n1 1 -1 1 -1\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test-case we can choose $(i, j)=(2, 3)$ twice and after that choose $(i, j)=(1, 2)$ twice too.

Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ in order from left to right ($k \\le n$). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, $a_i \\ne a_{i+1}$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment $[l,r]$ (from $l$ to $r$) are called indexes $i$ such that $l < i < r$, $a_{i - 1} < a_i$ and $a_i > a_{i + 1}$. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes $l$ and $r$ for the segment are not peaks. For example, if $n=8$ and $a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]$, then the segment $[1,8]$ has only two peaks (with indexes $3$ and $6$), and there are no peaks on the segment $[3, 6]$.\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment $[l,l+k-1]$ of consecutive mountains of length $k$ ($1 \\le l \\le n-k+1$). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to $p+1$, where $p$ is the number of peaks on the segment $[l,l+k-1]$.\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains $[l, l+k-1]$ that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value $l$ is minimal.\n\nFormally, you need to choose a segment of mountains $[l, l+k-1]$ that has the maximum number of peaks.

A word is called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nPolycarp wants to reverse some words from his set so that:\n\n- the final set of words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);\n- there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of words is consistent with the game rules.\n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words.

The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$\u00a0\u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i/s$ minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \\cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $tc$ ($1 \\le tc \\le 20$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$\u00a0\u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i/s$ minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \\cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest?

He always sets the volume of his TV to $b$. However, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to $a$. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume.\n\nThere are six buttons ($-5, -2, -1, +1, +2, +5$) on the control, which in one press can either increase or decrease the current volume by $1$, $2$, or $5$. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In other words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than $0$.\n\nAs Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to $b$ using as few button presses as possible.
