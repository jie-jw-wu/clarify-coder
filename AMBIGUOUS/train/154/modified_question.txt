Given a rectangular cake with height h and width w, and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts, where horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.
Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
However, the cake may have multiple valid interpretations, and some details about the cake's structure may be unspecified.
