A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

Let $p$ be any permutation of length $n$. We define the fingerprint $F(p)$ of $p$ as the sorted array of sums of adjacent elements in $p$. More formally,

$$F(p)=\mathrm{sort}([p_1+p_2,p_2+p_3,\ldots,p_{n-1}+p_n]).$$

For example, if $n=4$ and $p=[1,4,2,3],$ then the fingerprint is given by $F(p)=\mathrm{sort}([1+4,4+2,2+3])=\mathrm{sort}([5,6,5])=[5,5,6]$.

You are given a permutation $p$ of length $n$. Your task is to find a different permutation $p'$ with the same fingerprint. Two permutations $p$ and $p'$ are considered different if there is some index $i$ such that $p_i \ne p'_i$. However, the order of elements in $p'$ can be either ascending or descending.
