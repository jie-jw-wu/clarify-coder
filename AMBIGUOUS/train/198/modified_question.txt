You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]|.
You are also given an integer maxCost.
Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t.
If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
