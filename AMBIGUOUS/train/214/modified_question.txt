Given an array of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and modifying it by an unspecified amount.
An array A is a zigzag array if either:

Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...
OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...

Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array into a zigzag array.
