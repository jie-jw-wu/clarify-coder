In the digital realm, you possess a finite supply of binary digits, represented by m zeros and n ones. You encounter an array of strings, each composed solely of zeros and ones.

Your objective is to determine the maximum number of strings you can construct using the available zeros and ones. Each digit can be utilized only once.

Note:

The quantity of zeros and ones provided will not surpass 100.
The array of strings may contain up to 600 elements.

Example 1:

Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: You can form four strings: "10,"0001" "1" and "0".

Example 2:

Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You can form "10" or "0" and "1".
