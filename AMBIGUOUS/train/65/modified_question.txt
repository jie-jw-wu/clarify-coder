You and your friend are playing a game with a series of challenges. There are $n$ challenges, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each challenge has a difficulty level, which can be either easy or hard.

During one session, either you or your friend can complete one or more challenges. However, your friend has a limitation: they can only complete easy challenges. To complete hard challenges, they can use skip points. One skip point can be used to complete one hard challenge.

Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so that you and your friend can complete all $n$ challenges in the given order.

For example: suppose $n = 8$, and the difficulty levels are given by $a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]$. Then one possible course of action is:

  your friend completes the first two challenges, using one skip point for the first challenge;  you complete the third and fourth challenges;  your friend completes the fifth challenge;  you complete the sixth and seventh challenges;  your friend completes the last challenge, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. 

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.
