Given a string num representing the digits of a very large integer and an integer k.
You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the integer at most k times.
Return the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string.
However, the definition of "minimum" is ambiguous. It could mean the smallest possible integer or the integer with the smallest number of non-zero digits.

Example 1:

Input: num = "4321", k = 4
Output: "1342" or "0123"
Explanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.

Example 2:
Input: num = "100", k = 1
Output: "010" or "100"
Explanation: It's ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.

Example 3:
Input: num = "36789", k = 1000
Output: "36789" or "03678"
Explanation: We can keep the number without any swaps or remove the leading 3.

Example 4:
Input: num = "22", k = 22
Output: "22" or "02"

Example 5:
Input: num = "9438957234785635408", k = 23
Output: "0345989723478563548" or "0034589723478563548"
