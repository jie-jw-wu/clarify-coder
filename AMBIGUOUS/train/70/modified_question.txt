Word $s$ of length $n$ is called $k$-complete if it satisfies certain conditions. Bob is given a word $s$ and an integer $k$, and he wants to convert $s$ to any word that satisfies these conditions. He can do this by replacing some letters in $s$.

You are required to answer $t$ test cases independently.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t\le 10^5$) â€” the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k < n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n$ is divisible by $k$).

The second line of each test case contains a word $s$ of length $n$.

It is guaranteed that word $s$ only contains lowercase Latin letters. And it is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output one integer, representing the minimum number of characters he has to replace to convert $s$ to any word that satisfies the conditions.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, one optimal solution is aaaaaa.

In the second test case, the given word itself satisfies the conditions.
