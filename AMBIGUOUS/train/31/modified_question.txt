A skier traverses a snowy field, leaving a trail behind. The skier's movements are represented by a sequence of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E', where each character indicates a movement of $1$ meter in the corresponding direction.

The time taken to traverse a segment of the path depends on whether the segment has been previously visited. If the segment is unvisited, it takes $5$ seconds to traverse. If the segment has been visited before, it takes $1$ second to traverse.

Determine the total time taken by the skier to traverse the entire path.

-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing a non-empty string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed $10^5$ characters.

-----Output-----

For each test case, output the total time taken by the skier to traverse the path, in seconds.
