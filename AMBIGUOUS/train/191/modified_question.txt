Given an array of digits, you can write numbers using each digits[i] as many times as you want. For example, if digits = ['1','3','5'], you may write numbers such as '13', '551', and '1351315'.
Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer n. However, the digits array may contain duplicate elements, and the order of the digits in the generated numbers is not specified.
