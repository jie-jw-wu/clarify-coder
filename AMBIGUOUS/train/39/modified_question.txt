After a long party Petya decided to return home, but he turned out to be at the opposite end of the town from his home. There are $n$ crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.

The crossroads are represented as a string $s$ of length $n$, where $s_i = \texttt{A}$, if there is a bus station at $i$-th crossroad, and $s_i = \texttt{B}$, if there is a tram station at $i$-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to $s_1$) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to $s_n$).

If for two crossroads $i$ and $j$ for all crossroads $i, i+1, \ldots, j-1$ there is a bus station, one can pay $a$ roubles for the bus ticket, and go from $i$-th crossroad to the $j$-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the $j$-th crossroad). Formally, paying $a$ roubles Petya can go from $i$ to $j$ if $s_t = \texttt{A}$ for all $i \le t < j$. 

If for two crossroads $i$ and $j$ for all crossroads $i, i+1, \ldots, j-1$ there is a tram station, one can pay $b$ roubles for the tram ticket, and go from $i$-th crossroad to the $j$-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the $j$-th crossroad). Formally, paying $b$ roubles Petya can go from $i$ to $j$ if $s_t = \texttt{B}$ for all $i \le t < j$.

For example, if $s$="AABBBAB", $a=4$ and $b=3$ then Petya needs:[Image]  buy one bus ticket to get from $1$ to $3$,  buy one tram ticket to get from $3$ to $6$,  buy one bus ticket to get from $6$ to $7$. 

Thus, in total he needs to spend $4+3+4=11$ roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character $s_n$) does not affect the final expense.

Now Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the $n$-th crossroad. After the party he has left with $p$ roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.

Help him to choose the closest crossroad $i$ to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the $i$-th crossroad to the $n$-th, using only tram and bus tickets. If there are multiple valid choices for $i$, output the smallest one.
