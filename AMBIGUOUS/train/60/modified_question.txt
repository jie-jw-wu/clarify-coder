In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers $a$ and $b$ and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of ($a \oplus x$) + ($b \oplus x$) for any given $x$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. However, the quest may have multiple valid interpretations or unspecified details.
