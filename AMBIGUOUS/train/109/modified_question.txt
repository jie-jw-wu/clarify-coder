You have a bag of size $n$. Also you have $m$ boxes. The size of $i$-th box is $a_i$, where each $a_i$ is an integer non-negative power of two.

You can divide boxes into two parts of equal size or any other size. Your goal is to fill the bag completely.

For example, if $n = 10$ and $a = [1, 1, 32]$ then you can divide the box of size $32$ into two parts of size $16$, and then divide the box of size $16$ into two parts of size $8$. So you can fill the bag with boxes of size $1$, $1$ and $8$.

Calculate the minimum number of divisions required to fill the bag of size $n$.
