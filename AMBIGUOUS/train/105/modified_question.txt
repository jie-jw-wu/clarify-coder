— Hey folks, how do you like this problem?

— That'll do it. 

BThero is a powerful magician. He has got $n$ piles of candies, the $i$-th pile initially contains $a_i$ candies. BThero can cast a copy-paste spell as follows:   He chooses two piles $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$ and $i \ne j$.  All candies from pile $i$ are copied into pile $j$. Formally, the operation $a_j := a_j + a_i$ is performed. 

BThero can cast this spell any number of times he wants to — but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than $k$ candies, he loses his magic power. What is the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his power? Or, what is the minimum number of times BThero can cast the spell to lose his power?
