In the game Arena of Greed, two players take turns removing gold coins from a chest containing $N$ coins. The game ends when the chest is empty.

In each turn, a player can either:

* Take one gold coin from the chest.
* Take half of the gold coins in the chest, if the number of coins is even.

Both players play optimally to maximize their winnings. Determine the maximum number of coins Mr. Chanek can obtain if he plays first.

-----Input-----

The next $T$ lines each contain a single integer $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10^{18})$.


-----Output-----

$T$ lines, each line is the answer requested by Mr. Chanek.
