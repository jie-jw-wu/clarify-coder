Alice and Bob play a game with a binary string $s$. They take turns deleting consecutive characters from the string, with the goal of maximizing their score. The score is determined by the number of $1$-characters deleted.

During their turn, a player can choose any number of consecutive characters in $s$ and delete them. The characters to the left and to the right of the removed block become adjacent.

The game ends when the string becomes empty.

Calculate the resulting score of Alice.
