You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Let's define the $k$-amazing number of the array as a number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length $k$ (recall that a subsegment of $a$ of length $k$ is a contiguous part of $a$ containing exactly $k$ elements). If there is no such number for some value of $k$, then the $k$-amazing number is undefined.

For each $k$ from $1$ to $n$ calculate the $k$-amazing number of the array $a$.
