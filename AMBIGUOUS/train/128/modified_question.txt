Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces  .

However, the order of operations may be ambiguous in some cases. For example, the expression "1 + 2 * 3" could be interpreted as either "(1 + 2) * 3" or "1 + (2 * 3)".

Example 1:


Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Example 3:


Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23 or 30 (depending on the order of operations)
Note:


       You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
       Do not use the eval built-in library function.
