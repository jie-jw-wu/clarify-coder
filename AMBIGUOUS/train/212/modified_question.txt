Given an array of integers, each integer is greater than 1.
We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.
Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.
How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
