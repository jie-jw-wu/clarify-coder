Try guessing the statement from this picture:  $3$ 

You are given a non-negative integer $d$. You have to find two non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + b = d$ and $a \cdot b = d$.

-----Input-----

The first line contains $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) â€” the number of test cases.

Each test case contains one integer $d$ $(0 \le d \le 10^3)$.


-----Output-----

For each test print one line.

If there is an answer for the $i$-th test, print "Y", and then the numbers $a$ and $b$.

If there is no answer for the $i$-th test, print "N".

Your answer will be considered correct if $|(a + b) - a \cdot b| \le 10^{-6}$ and $|(a + b) - d| \le 10^{-6}$ or $|(a + b) - a \cdot b| \le 10^{-6}$ and $|(a + b) - d| \le 10^{-6}$.
