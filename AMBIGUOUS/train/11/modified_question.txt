You have a string $s$ — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:  'W' — move one cell up;  'S' — move one cell down;  'A' — move one cell left;  'D' — move one cell right. 

Let $Grid(s)$ be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands $s$. For example, if $s = \text{DSAWWAW}$ then $Grid(s)$ is the $4 \times 3$ grid:  you can place the robot in the cell $(3, 2)$;  the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to $(3, 3)$;  the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to $(4, 3)$;  the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $(4, 2)$;  the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $(3, 2)$;  the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $(2, 2)$;  the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $(2, 1)$;  the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $(1, 1)$.

You have $4$ extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insert at most one of these letters in any position of sequence $s$ to minimize the area of $Grid(s)$.

What is the minimum area of $Grid(s)$ you can achieve? Or, what is the maximum area of $Grid(s)$ you can achieve?
