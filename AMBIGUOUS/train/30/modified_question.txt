You are given a string $s$ of length $n$. String $s$ is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's.

In one operation you can reverse any substring of $s$. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.

What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string $s$ alternating? A string is alternating if $s_i \neq s_{i + 1}$ for all $i$.
