You are given a picture consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from the top to the bottom, columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$ from the left to the right. Each cell is painted either black or white. 

You think that this picture is not interesting enough. You consider a picture to be interesting if there is at least one cross or a diagonal in it. A cross is represented by a pair of numbers $x$ and $y$, where $1 \le x \le n$ and $1 \le y \le m$, such that all cells in row $x$ and all cells in column $y$ are painted black. A diagonal is represented by a pair of numbers $x$ and $y$, where $1 \le x \le n$ and $1 \le y \le m$, such that all cells on the diagonal from $(x, y)$ to $(n, m)$ are painted black.

For examples, each of these pictures contain crosses or diagonals:

The fourth picture contains 4 crosses: at $(1, 3)$, $(1, 5)$, $(3, 3)$ and $(3, 5)$. The fifth picture contains 2 diagonals: from $(1, 1)$ to $(5, 5)$ and from $(1, 5)$ to $(5, 1)$.

Following images don't contain crosses or diagonals:

You have a brush and a can of black paint, so you can make this picture interesting. Each minute you may choose a white cell and paint it black.

What is the minimum number of minutes you have to spend so the resulting picture contains at least one cross or diagonal?
