A password is considered strong if it meets certain criteria.

It has a certain number of characters.
It contains certain types of characters.
It does not contain certain patterns.

Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.

Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change.
