Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1. A scrambled string is a string that can be obtained by rearranging the characters of the original string. However, the definition of "rearranging" is ambiguous. It could mean swapping the characters of any two nodes in the binary tree representation of the string, or it could mean swapping the characters of any two substrings of the string.
