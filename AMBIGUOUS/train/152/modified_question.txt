In a parallel universe, Rick discovered a peculiar magnetic force between balls placed in his innovative baskets. Rick has n empty baskets, each located at a specific position[i]. Morty possesses m balls and intends to distribute them among the baskets. However, the distribution must be such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized.

Rick explained that the magnetic force between two balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.

Given the array position and the integer m, determine the maximum possible minimum magnetic force that can be achieved by distributing the balls among the baskets.

Example 1:

Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3 (or any other valid interpretation)

Example 2:
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999 (or any other valid interpretation)

Constraints:

n == position.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= position[i] <= 10^9
All integers in position are distinct.
2 <= m <= position.length
