Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.
Return the maximum dot product between subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
A subsequence of an array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
The subsequences can be of any length, and they can overlap.
The dot product of two arrays is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements.
For example, the dot product of [2,3,5] and [3,0,-6] is (2*3 + 3*0 + 5*(-6)) = -15.
