A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!

You are given integers $n,k$. Construct a grid $A$ with size $n \times n$ consisting of integers $0$ and $1$. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $k$. In other words, the number of $1$ in the grid is equal to $k$.

Let's define:  $A_{i,j}$ as the integer in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.  $R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n}$ (for all $1 \le i \le n$).  $C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j}$ (for all $1 \le j \le n$).  In other words, $R_i$ are row sums and $C_j$ are column sums of the grid $A$.  For the grid $A$ let's define the value $f(A) = (\max(R)-\min(R))^2 + (\max(C)-\min(C))^2$ (here for an integer sequence $X$ we define $\max(X)$ as the maximum value in $X$ and $\min(X)$ as the minimum value in $X$). 

Find any grid $A$, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value $f(A)$ is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.

However, there are multiple interpretations of the problem statement:

1. The condition "the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $k$" can be interpreted as the sum of all elements in the grid being equal to $k$, or as the sum of all $1$s in the grid being equal to $k$.
2. The condition "the value $f(A)$ is the minimum possible" can be interpreted as the value of $f(A)$ being the smallest possible among all grids that satisfy the condition, or as the value of $f(A)$ being the smallest possible among all grids that satisfy the condition and have the same sum of all elements.
