There are $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. For the one move you can choose any value $c$ and divide by two all elements that equal $c$.

For example, if $a=[6,8,12,6,3,12]$ and you choose $c=6$, and $a$ is transformed into $a=[3,8,12,3,3,12]$ after the move.

You need to find the minimal number of moves for transforming $a$ to an array of only odd integers (each element shouldn't be divisible by $2$).
