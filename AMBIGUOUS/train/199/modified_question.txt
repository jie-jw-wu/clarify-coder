Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements in an array of integers.

The algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:


Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

However, it is not specified whether the sequence should be in ascending or descending order, or if it can wrap around (e.g., [4, 3, 2, 1] would be considered a consecutive sequence).
