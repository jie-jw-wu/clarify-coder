Screen resolution of Polycarp's monitor is $a \times b$ pixels. Unfortunately, there are some dead pixels at his screen. You can consider columns of pixels to be numbered from $0$ to $a-1$, and rows — from $0$ to $b-1$.

Polycarp wants to open a rectangular window of maximal size, which doesn't contain any of the dead pixels. The boundaries of the window should be parallel to the sides of the screen.

Print the maximal area (in pixels) of a window that doesn't contain any of the dead pixels inside itself.
