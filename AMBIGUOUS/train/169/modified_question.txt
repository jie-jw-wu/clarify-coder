Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).

Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58. However, it is not specified whether the integers in the sum must be distinct or not.
