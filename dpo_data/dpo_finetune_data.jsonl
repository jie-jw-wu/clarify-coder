{"type": "Incomplete", "prompt": "Problem: Last winter, an avalanche swept away all the ski lifts from the ski resort Valen. Instead of rebuilding the lifts like they were before, the plan is to do it in a more optimized way, and you are responsible for this. \n\nThe only thing remaining from the old lift system are $n$ pylons situated at integer coordinates in the plane. You would like to put lifts in the form of line segments between some of these pylons. The line segments must satisfy the following constraints:\n - A line segment can only go between pylons $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ if $|y_1-y_2| = 1$.\n - There are two types of pylons, one-way and two-way pylons. The one-way pylons can be connected to at most one other pylon, and the two-way pylons can be connected to at most two other pylons. \n\nWhat is the maximum number of ski lifts (line segments) you can place under these constraints?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$).
