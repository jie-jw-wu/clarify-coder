{"prompt": "Problem: Last winter, an avalanche swept away all the ski lifts from the ski resort Valen. Instead of rebuilding the lifts like they were before, the plan is to do it in a more optimized way, and you are responsible for this. \n\nThe only thing remaining from the old lift system are $n$ pylons situated at integer coordinates in the plane. You would like to put lifts in the form of line segments between some of these pylons. The line segments must satisfy the following constraints:\n - A line segment can only go between pylons $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ if $|y_1-y_2| = 1$.\n - There are two types of pylons, one-way and two-way pylons. The one-way pylons can be connected to at most one other pylon, and the two-way pylons can be connected to at most two other pylons. \n\nWhat is the maximum number of ski lifts (line segments) you can place under these constraints?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$). Each of the following $n$ lines contains three integers $x$, $y$, and $a$, the coordinates and type of a pylon ($0 \\leq x,y \\leq 10^5$; $a=1$ for a one-way pylon and $a=2$ for a two-way pylon). All the pylons are situated at different coordinates.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the maximum number of ski lift line segments that can be placed.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n8\n1 0 1\n3 0 2\n0 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 2\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n4 3 1\nSample Output:\n4\n\nSolution:", "chosen": "1. What is the maximum number of pylons that can be connected to a single two-way pylon?\n2. Are there any additional constraints on the placement of line segments beyond those specified in the problem description?\n3. Are there any restrictions on the orientation of line segments relative to the x-axis or y-axis?", "rejected": "**Incorrect Version:**\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Problem: Pashmak decided to give Parmida a pair of flowers from the garden. There are n flowers in the garden and the i-th of them has a beauty number b_{i}. Parmida is a very strange girl so she doesn't want to have the two most beautiful flowers necessarily. She wants to have those pairs of flowers that their beauty difference is maximal possible!\n\nYour task is to write a program which calculates two things:  The maximum beauty difference of flowers that Pashmak can give to Parmida.  The number of ways that Pashmak can pick the flowers. Two ways are considered different if and only if there is at least one flower that is chosen in the first way and not chosen in the second way. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5).
